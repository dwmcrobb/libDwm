\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class defines an interface for classes that can write their contents to an ostream, file descriptor or FILE pointer. 

Note that this class is deprecated as of lib\+Dwm-\/0.\+8.\+0, and is now just a grouping of \doxylink{classDwm_1_1DescriptorWritable}{Descriptor\+Writable}, \doxylink{classDwm_1_1FileWritable}{File\+Writable} and \doxylink{classDwm_1_1StreamWritable}{Stream\+Writable}. The older version of this class also included a Streamed\+Length() pure virtual member. To get that interface, you now need to add \doxylink{classDwm_1_1StreamedLengthCapable}{Streamed\+Length\+Capable} to any derived class. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
\mbox{\hyperlink{DwmWritable_8hh}{Dwm\+Writable.\+hh}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
