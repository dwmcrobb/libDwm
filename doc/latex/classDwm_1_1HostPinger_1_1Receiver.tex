\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Data callback interface. 

{\ttfamily destination} is the destination being pinged. {\ttfamily recv\+Time} is the time of reception (or the time at which we timed out the ping). {\ttfamily rtt} is the round trip time. If rtt.\+Secs() is 0x\+FFFFFFFF, we did not receive a response to the ping. To use this interface, you must derive from this class and implement the () operator, then register it via \doxylink{classDwm_1_1HostPinger_a75feec46b0e6cf13f28876b1dceb6690}{Set\+Receiver()}. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
